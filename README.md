# 544-smt-project

This is a Keras implementation of RNN Encoder-Decoder, written for as a final project for CSCI-544.

As we started modifying code from a Tensorflow tutorial, some of the routines such as command line options
and basic file reading routines might resemble the original tutorial code, however, we re-implemented most
of the key parts namely:

1. Our training model is completely re-written with Keras.
2. The WMT dataset is processed with DataFeed, an self sufficient class that handles processing, reading
   and producing batches from the data.
3. A beam search is performed to sample the output probability distribution to get reasonable outcome.
